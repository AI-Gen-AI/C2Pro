"""
CTO Gates Verification Test Suite

This module contains tests that verify the four critical CTO security gates:
- Gate 1: Row Level Security (RLS)
- Gate 2: Identity & Authentication
- Gate 3: MCP Security
- Gate 4: Traceability & Audit Logging

These tests generate evidence for CTO review before production deployment.
